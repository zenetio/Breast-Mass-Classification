# Breast-Mass-Classification
The idea of this repository is to build, train, and test some models based on some challenges and papaers.<br>
One paper that has some interesting content is "The Automated Learning of Deep Features for Breast Mass Classification from Mammograms". Note that, if we dont have the source code, there is no way to reproduce the exact results, but its really fun
try to stay as close as possible, based on what we can get from the paper.
